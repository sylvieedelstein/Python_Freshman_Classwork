#This is my pseudocode mapping out my final project

#Define first function
    #The program begins with text laying out a scene in a subway station
    #object1 is set to false
    #object2 is set to false
    #object3 is set to false
    #Define a function for first choice (investigate objects in the space, or move rooms)
        #Return user choice
    #function if user chose to investigate
        #user choice (pick up item or leave item)
        #if object is picked up object is set to true
        #return to function (resets back to the first choice. They can now choose to leave the space.)
    #function if you leave the station
        #define a function for second choice to examine the area or walk
    
    #function room option 2
